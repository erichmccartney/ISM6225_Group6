        Rocky the Bull is new to programming and is having trouble understating 
        the importance of time complexity. Professor Agrawal assigned you the job 
        of explaining time complexity to Rocky with the example below.

        Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

        Example 1:
        Input: nums1 = [2,5,5,2], nums2 = [5,5]
        Output: [5,5]

        Example 2:
        Input: nums1 = [3,6,2], nums2 = [6,3,6,7,3]
        Output: [3,6]
        
        Note:
        •	Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
        •	The result can be in any order.
        •	Submit 2 Solutions where time complexity of the methods is be less than O(n^2). 

        Hint1: You can sort the both arrays and then compute the intersection, in this way you 
        will achieve a time complexity of O(n log n). 
        
        Hint2: If you make use of a dictionary, you need not sort the arrays to compute the 
        intersection. The time complexity in this case will be O(n).
