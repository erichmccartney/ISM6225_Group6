        Professor Stablein is given a sorted integer array. He needs to make 
        the array elements distinct by increasing each value as needed, while 
        minimizing the array sum. Professor Stablein thought this was an 
        interesting exercise that the students might enjoy completing. Your 
        job is to complete the method to print the minimum possible sum as 
        output.

        Example : 
        Input : arr[] = {2,2,3,5,6};			Output: 20
        Explanation: Array is transformed to {2,3,4,5,6}. Sum becomes 2+3+4+5+6=20
        Input arr[]= {40,40};				Output: 81
        Explanation: Array is transformed to {40,41}. Sum becomes 81
        Input: arr[] = {4,5,6,9};			Output : 24
        Explanation: As the array is sorted and has distinct elements. So result is 
        sum of each elements in the array.

        Time Complexity: O(n)
        public static int minSum(int[] arr)
