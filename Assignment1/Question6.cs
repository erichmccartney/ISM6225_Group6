        /*
        You are given an array of characters and an integer k, and are required 
        to find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array 
        such that arr[i]=arr[j] and the absolute difference between i and j is 
        at most k.

        Example 1: 

        Input: arr=[a,g,h,a], k=3
        Output= true

        Explanation= arr[0] and arr[3] contains “a”; hence the absolute difference 
        between 0 and 3 is 3 which is equal to 3 therefore output is true.

        Example 2: arr=[k,y,k,k], k=1
        Output= true
        Example 3: 
        Input: arr=[a,b,c,a,b,c], k=2
        Output: false
        Explanation= arr[0]=arr[3] but absolute difference is not at most 2 
                    arr[1]=arr[4] but absolute difference is not at most 2
                    arr[2]=arr[5] but absolute difference is not at most 2
                    There fore output is false.
